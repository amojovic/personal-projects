The idea originally was to create remote contolled 'machine' that slides on the ground.

I greatly underestimated the weight of the parts and i had no wheels at the moment so i settled for the airboat design.

Greatest worry here was that water would enter the container but luckily in the end it floats.

The code is pretty simple, there are receiver and transmitter ends (both sides are arduino with RF24 module).

I left images of how it looks and 'schematic' for how i constructed it in the 'images' folder.
