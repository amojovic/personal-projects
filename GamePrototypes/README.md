Welcome to my collection of game prototypes!
This repository contains various game projects I started but eventually set aside.

About the Projects:

Developed using Unity and Godot game engines.

Mostly 2D games, showcasing different animation techniques, art styles, and gameplay mechanics I’ve experimented with.

Includes one 3D project (SpiderPrototype) demonstrating inverse kinematics (IK).

I’m currently working on other more polished games which are private for now, but I wanted to make these early beginner prototypes available for review.
