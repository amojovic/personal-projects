# Personal Projects

Welcome to my personal projects repository! This collection showcases a range of prototypes and experiments I've built to explore different areas of software development, with a focus on game development, robotics, and Python-based tools.

## üéÆ Game Development

I enjoy creating gameplay prototypes and systems using Unity and Godot. My game projects explore mechanics, physics simulations, and interaction design. These prototypes help me learn and iterate quickly on new gameplay ideas.

**Tools & technologies:**
- Unity (C#)
- Godot (GDScript & C#)

## ü§ñ Robotics

I‚Äôve developed experimental projects that involve robotic control systems and sensor integrations, often using Python. These include:
- Small-scale robot motion control
- Sensor data processing
- Radio frequency communication between modules

**Technologies used:**
- Python (OpenCV, PySerial, etc.)
- Arduino (for some hardware-level prototypes)

## üêç Python Prototypes

I frequently use Python to create quick prototypes and test ideas, including:
- Simulation scripts
- Testing simple game ideas
- Data processing experiments
